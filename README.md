# Forecasting Gold Prices using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) 

This file is for the examiner to guide you on how to load up and run the notebook I have uploaded for my project.

Firstly, as my supporting material I have attached the source code for my two models of price level model and 
my price change model. This consists of two jupyter notebook ipynb files. I have also attached the CSV file which 
is key to importing the dataset to get the notebook to run. The dataset labelled 'Gold_Historical' contains the
daily gold prices dataset of 2012 - 2022 which is used throughout the project notebook. This will need to be uploaded 
to the notebook using pandas and my code will execute this.

You need access to a jupyter notebook software to acccess my source code. The Gold_Historical CSV file must 
be in the same folder as the source code for it to import correctly. Once you upload the CSV file to the 
jupyter notebook both notebooks will execute with no issues.
